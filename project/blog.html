                    <p>"I had a great experience at Amity University. The campus is well-equipped with modern infrastructure, including libraries, labs, and sports facilities. The faculty members are knowledgeable and approachable, always ready to help students with doubts. Amity offers ample opportunities for extracurricular activities, from cultural events to technical fests, which helped me develop my skills beyond academics. The placement cell is also quite active, ensuring good job opportunities for students. Overall, it’s a great place to learn and grow."</p>

                    <p>"Amity University has a beautiful campus and a wide range of courses to choose from, which is great for students with diverse interests. However, the fee structure can be on the higher side compared to some other universities. While the faculty is generally good, some departments could improve their teaching methodologies. Placements are decent but vary significantly depending on the course and branch. Overall, it’s a decent option, but students should weigh the costs and benefits carefully before enrolling."</p>
